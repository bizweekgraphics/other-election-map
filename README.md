If we blot out the red-blue bipole, we see a polychrome network of small beginnings, rarely to become a big thing â€” driven less by pragmatism and partisan sentiment than by protest votes, outlets for ejections of civic angst. What does it mean? It is the colors of a television tuned to a dead channel; the sound of a radio between stations. It is our background radiation.

Colors are randomized so as not to reify the unreal.
