# Best of the Rest: The Other Election Map

If you block out the disk of the Sun, as in an eclipse, you see its corona: a wild, undulating aura of plasma loops, arcs, jets, and holes. There, past the transition region above the chromosphere, gravity no longer holds sway; behavior is instead dominated by magnetic forces, field lines made manifest.

And so it is in American politics! If we blot out the dominant bipole of Republicans and Democrats, we see a dynamic menagerie driven less by pragmatism than protest votes, outlets for ejections of civic angst. Below, explore a map of the leading U.S. Senate candidate in every county, excluding the two major parties.

Beneath the red and blue is a polychrome network of small beginnings, rarely to become a big thing.

"And as the evening twilight fades away / The sky is filled with stars, invisible by day." â€”Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
