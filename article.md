# Best of the Rest: The 'Other' Election Map

If you block out the disk of the Sun, as in an eclipse, you will see its corona: a wild, undulating aura of plasma loops, arcs, jets, and holes. There, past the transition region above the chromosphere, gravity no longer holds sway; behavior is instead dominated by magnetic forces, field lines made manifest.

And so it is in American politics! If we blot out the dominant bipole of Republicans and Democrats, we see a dynamic menagerie driven less by pragmatism than protest votes, outlets for ejections of civic angst.

Airline pilot **Curt Gottshall** takes the Wyoming Senate seat with 13,175 votes on a platform of returning "honor and integrity" to Washington. The next governor of Texas is Libertarian **Kathie Glass**, who ran because "every thing that I love is under attack by an increasingly tyrannical federal government with no effective resistance." And Delaware Senate victor **Andrew Groff** (Green) promises, "We will not be slaves to corporate political party manipulation."

"And as the evening twilight fades away / The sky is filled with stars, invisible by day." â€”Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
